======================
Documentation of the project can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/hampussandberg/HexConnect/wiki)

## Current Status
The first version of the Serial Monitor is done and working. It has been a great way of finding out what things to improve for the next revisions and what's already working as it should.

Software for version 2 is written as fast as humanly possible and is documented here on the wiki.

### Version 2.0:
More info on the mockup below can be found on the [mockup page](https://github.com/hampussandberg/HexConnect/wiki/Revision-2-Mockup).
