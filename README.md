Serial-Monitor-Project
======================
Documentation of the project can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/hampussandberg/Serial-Monitor-Project/wiki)

## Current Status
The first revision of the Serial Monitor is done and working. It has been a great way of finding out what things to improve for the next revisions and what's already working as it should.  
For revision 2 the system level design is basically done as can be seen on the [mockup page](https://github.com/hampussandberg/Serial-Monitor-Project/wiki/Revision-2-Mockup) and I'm currently in the process of finding suitable components while working on the new PCBs.
